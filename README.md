# SGC-UNC_nsP2-Protease_Covalent-Inhibitors

Chikungunya (CHIKV) is an enveloped, positive single-stranded-RNA virus with pandemic potential that causes severe chronic arthritis. CHIKV nsP2 encodes a Papain-like cysteine protease that is essential for viral replication. Pyrazole (E)-vinyl sulfone RA-0002034 was identified as a potent CHIKV nsp2 protease inhibitor from a targeted screen of covalent cysteine-reactive fragments in the READDI Antiviral Drug Discovery Center. Initial resynthesis of the hit compound yielded a 1:1 mixture of acyclic (3) and cyclic sulfones (4) (Figure 1), which were separable only by HPLC. Extensive chemical and analytical method development led to the synthesis and characterization of the pure acyclic and cyclic vinyl sulfones. Optimal conditions for conversion of the acyclic to cyclic sulfone by intramolecular aza-Michael reaction were also identified. Hit-to-lead optimization incorporated structural modifications on: 1) the left-hand side aromatic group, 2) the central heterocyclic core, and 3) the right-hand side covalent warhead. The 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl substituted analog was found to have kinact/Ki >9000 and improved microsomal stability compared to the initial hit. An isoxazole core was found to be equipotent with original pyrazole but immune to intramolecular cyclization. Methyl vinyl sulfone was consistently the most potent warhead. Interestingly, cyano substitution at the pyrazole 4-position further improved kinact/Ki. The major challenge in this series of covalent nsP2 inhibitors is to address the poor pharmacokinetics by decreasing the GSH reactivity and improving plasma stability through synthesis of acyclic analogs with detuned warheads. Alternatively, we are exploring modifications of the core that favor the retro-aza-Michael reaction, opening the possibility of using a cyclic analog as a pro-drug.
