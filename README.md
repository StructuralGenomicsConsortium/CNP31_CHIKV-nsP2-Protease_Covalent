# SGC-UNC_CHIKV-nsP2-Protease_Covalent

An SGC Open Chemistry Networks Project devoted to the discovery and development of CHIKV nsP2 Protease covalent inhibitors. Chikungunya (CHIKV) is an enveloped, positive single-stranded-RNA virus with pandemic potential that causes severe chronic arthritis. CHIKV nsP2 encodes a Papain-like cysteine protease that is essential for viral replication. This project aims to develop compounds against CHIKV nsP2 Protease as starting points for medicines for future coronavirus pandemics. A targeted screen of covalent cysteine-reactive fragments in the READDI Antiviral Drug Discovery Center at UNC Chapel Hill, USA identified a nanomolar potent CHIKV nsP2 protease inhibitor. The group is currently involved in hit-to-lead optimization by doing extensive SAR, analysis of physchem properties, GSH reactivity studies, in vitro and in vivo PK, metID studies to develop a first-in-class CHIKV nsP2 Protease covalent inhibitor.

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the ["How To" Area](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/Chemistry_TechOps_HowTo/wiki)
